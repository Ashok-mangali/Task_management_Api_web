I developed a Task Management API.

Create a RESTful API for a Task Management Application using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The application should demonstrate an understanding of backend development, database interactions, and API design.

To create the application:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Task_manager
   ```

2. Initialize the project:
   ```
   npm init
   ```

To start the application:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Task_manager
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
